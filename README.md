# Guessing Game

In this project, I created an application that allows users to input any number ranging from 1-100. If the user guesses incorrectly then it will tell the user if the number was too big or too small. Lastly it allows the user to keep inputting a number until they input the correct number. At that point the game will automatically end itself. The number is a random generated number that changes every time the user runs the application.
